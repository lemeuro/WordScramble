# WordScramble

Word game - you need to make as many small words as possible from one random word.

The application is interesting in that it uses elements of UIKit and Objective-C to check the realism of a word and check the word against a dictionary.

The application pulls up a local text file from which words are subsequently pulled out and converted into an array. After the user enters a word, there are several checks with guard, after which the word is displayed on the screen.
